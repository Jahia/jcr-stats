# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.1] — Unreleased

### Changed

- **Tree Traversal Strategy** — The size computation now walks the JCR hierarchy directly via `JCRNodeWrapper.getNodes()` instead of firing one `ISCHILDNODE` JCR-SQL2 query per node. This removes a per-node query parse/plan/index lookup plus a redundant path resolution, making large-subtree computations substantially faster, and reads committed hierarchy state instead of possibly-lagging Lucene index state. The legacy query-based strategy remains available for A/B benchmarking via the `-DjcrStats.traversal=query` system property (default: `direct`).
- **Session Refresh** — `session.refresh(false)` now runs once at the start of a traversal instead of once per node (the per-node refresh was needless overhead on a read-only walk).

### Fixed

- **Whole-site traversal no longer aborts on un-listable branches** — Walking a subtree that descends into an external data-source mount whose child names are not valid JCR paths (e.g. `cloud-dumps` nodes named with an ISO-8601 timestamp, where `:` is the namespace-prefix separator) raised `RepositoryException: Invalid path … ':' not valid name character` and aborted the entire computation. The traversal is now best-effort: it logs a `WARN` and skips an un-enumerable node (or a single failing child) instead of failing the whole job. The hard `MAX_VISITED_NODES` safety limit still aborts as before.

### Tests

- Added `JcrStatsTraversalTest` covering the direct-traversal aggregation logic (size roll-up, node count, single-visit guarantee, size-descending child ordering) with mocked `JCRNodeWrapper`s; introduced a `test`-scoped Mockito dependency.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-23

### Added

- **GraphQL API** — New `jcrStats` namespace under root Query and Mutation, supporting:
  - Query operations: `size(path)`, `nodeCount(path)`, `tree(path, maxDepth)`, `status()`, `result(maxDepth)`, `reports()`
  - Mutations: `compute(path)` (fire-and-forget async start), `computeSize(path, deleteTemporaryFile)` (synchronous full flamegraph)
  - All operations require `jcrStatsAdmin` permission
  - Recursive node tree with depth limiting for efficient payload size

- **Asynchronous Computation** — Background job model for large subtree traversal:
  - `compute(path)` mutation starts a single server-wide background job (no-op if one is already running)
  - `status()` query returns live progress: running flag, elapsed time (ms), visited node count, path, error state
  - `result(maxDepth)` query returns the cached tree once computation completes
  - Client-side polling pattern: fire compute, poll status every 2s, fetch result on completion
  - Progress UI shows elapsed timer and scanned-node counter
  - Resume-on-remount: navigating away from the page and back resumes status display of a still-running job

- **React Admin UI** — Interactive space analysis interface at `/jahia/administration/jcrStats`:
  - **Flamegraph View** — Click-to-zoom interactive visualization of space usage; keyboard hint advises use of Tree table for keyboard access
  - **Tree Table View** — Hierarchical breakdown with columns for size, % of total, % of parent, and node count; fully keyboard accessible
  - **Largest Items View** — Sorted top-N list of space consumers
  - **Comparison View** — Snapshot diff to track space changes over time
  - **Progress Indicator** — While computing: animated loader + elapsed timer + live scanned-node count
  - **Snapshot Save/Load** — Download current tree as JSON; upload previously saved snapshots; load baselines for comparison

- **Metrics** — Support for weighting analysis by:
  - **Size (bytes)** — Disk usage analysis
  - **Number of nodes** — Structure and complexity analysis

- **Snapshot Management** — Save and load analysis results:
  - Download snapshots as JSON files
  - Upload previously saved snapshots
  - Load baseline snapshots for comparison/diff view

- **jContent Deep Links** — Click-through navigation from analysis results directly into the jContent editor for selected nodes

- **JcrStatsComputer** — Reusable traversal and flamegraph-generation engine shared by:
  - Karaf shell command (`jcr-stats:compute-size`)
  - GraphQL API mutations
  - Admin UI backend operations
  - Ensures consistency across all three interfaces (DRY principle)

- **Security & Access Control**:
  - New `jcrStatsAdmin` permission (defined in `src/main/import/permissions.xml`)
  - New `jcr-stats-administrator` role (defined in `src/main/import/roles.xml`) bundling `administrationAccess` + `jcrStatsAdmin`, marked as privileged
  - All GraphQL operations and admin UI require the `jcrStatsAdmin` permission

- **Unit Tests** — Comprehensive test coverage for:
  - JcrStatsComputer traversal logic
  - NodeStats recursive structure
  - Edge cases (empty paths, large trees, permission validation)

- **E2E Tests** — Docker-based Cypress harness covering:
  - Admin UI workflow (path input, compute, view switching)
  - Snapshot save/load functionality
  - Comparison view behavior
  - GraphQL query and mutation execution

- **Frontend Build** — React application compiled via `frontend-maven-plugin`:
  - Managed Node/Yarn installation during Maven build
  - ESLint configuration for code quality
  - Production build optimization

### Changed

- **Root Package Renamed** — From `org.jahia.modules.*` to `org.jahia.community.jcrstats` (community module convention)
- **Module Type** — Declared as `system` type module in `pom.xml`
- **Karaf Command** — Refactored to delegate to `JcrStatsComputer` for shared logic
- **Administration Menu** — Merged the two-level "JCR Statistics → Compute size" navigation into a single selectable **JCR Statistics** entry under System Health (route `jcrStats`); removed the redundant intermediate group
- **Job Logging** — The asynchronous computation now emits `INFO` log lines when a job starts and when it finishes (with elapsed time and visited-node count)

### Deprecated

- Direct use of ComputeSizeCommand for programmatic access; use GraphQL API or JcrStatsComputer instead

### Fixed

- Defensive node-count traversal cap prevents unbounded memory use on pathologically large trees
- Hardened JSON-import validation for snapshot upload (strict schema enforcement)

### Security

- All GraphQL operations validate `jcrStatsAdmin` permission at execution time
- **JCR traversal uses a privileged system session**: The `compute(path)` and `computeSize(path)` operations use `JCRTemplate.doExecuteWithSystemSession`, which bypasses node-level read ACLs. Consequently, holding the `jcrStatsAdmin` permission grants full-repository structural/size visibility regardless of per-node JCR read permissions. This is intentional—administrators need to understand the full storage footprint. When assigning the `jcr-stats-administrator` role, treat it as granting broad read-visibility into the entire JCR tree.
- Flamegraph HTML files are generated with safe, non-executable content
- Input validation on path parameters; JCR node traversal bounded by configurable depth limit

## [2.0.x] — Earlier

Earlier releases provided only the Karaf `jcr-stats:compute-size` command. Detailed changelog not maintained.

---

## Notes

- **MAX_DEPTH Coupling** — The flame graph depth limit is set to 6 levels and is hardcoded in JcrStatsQuery.DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH, JcrStats.jsx MAX_DEPTH constant, and the GraphQL query nesting structure. When changing this value, update all three locations.

- **Flamegraph Storage** — Generated HTML files are persisted at `/sites/systemsite/files/jcr-stats/` in the JCR for archival and later comparison.

- **Permission Model** — The `jcrStatsAdmin` permission is intentionally granular to allow access without granting full server administration rights. Assign the `jcr-stats-administrator` role for convenient management.

- **Backward Compatibility** — The Karaf `jcr-stats:compute-size` command is maintained for CLI users. The GraphQL API is the recommended programmatic interface for new integrations.
